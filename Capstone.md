INTRODUCTION
CYBER THE LEARNING APP as its name suggest is a social application design where people can initiate and start learning things about the cyber security which will provide them knowledge starting from basic to intermediate level.
In this regular news from the cyber world will be provided where people will came to know about things happing in the cyber world.
And a course named as “Cyber Security Essential” will be covered in this application.
The syllabus will motivate user to become cyber security professional, user will came to know about CIA (Confidentiality -Integrity -Availability) paradigm.
We will be providing the attractive form of data (user friendly interface) which will attract users to come and learn about cyber security.




1.1 Objective of the project
Main objective of the project is to provide the basic knowledge of cyber world to every person which will spread the awareness about the basic cyber security and for students it is a valuable application by which they will come to know about the things happening in cyber world by our news system.
User will gain some knowledge about securing the computing system.
User will be able to detect if something wrong is happening with their system.

1.2 Description of the project
       As the things are happening in today’s world it should be there that the people are having some knowledge in the cyber security field i.e knowledge of smart phone they are using, appliances in their home which can be compromise like personal computer, laptop , tablet etc.
In this we will be focusing on interface for the user that it should user friendly so that user can interact eaisly. 
There will be regular new content about the happening of things in cyber world.
User can bookmark the article for reading it later. 
1.3 Scope of the project
 Initially application will contain data on the basis of cyber security but later we will provide Video lecture on some other subject related to cyber security like Networking is also a main field under cyber security.
And in future there is more chance to provide course on “Forensic” as well as on “securing computing system”.




SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
2.1 User Profile
A person can register as a new user with some credential like mail ID, First name, Last name and new password for the login purpose.
The profiles of users shall contain the following: 
First name 
Last name
Phone number 
Location
Mail ID

2.2 Functional Requirements
2.2.1 User registration
The application shall allow users to register and create a profile .
2.2.2 User authentication
When registering, the application shall allow users to authenticate using their user name and password.
2.2.3 User login
Users shall be able deactivate their account.
Users shall be able log out.

2.3 Non-Functional-Requirements
2.3.1 Performance:
The application performance should be optimised, and response time should be minimized.
2.3.2 Scalability:
The application should be highly scalable; since it is meant to be used by people around the world.
2.3.3 Extensibility:
The application should be extensible to allow adding other services in the future, such as using profiles from Facebook. Also, allowing integration with other APIs such as Google maps and OpenID.
2.3.4 Integration:
The system should have the ability to extend its requirements. For example, having the ability to extend with the minimum development and deployment costs.
2.3.5 Security:
The system should be highly secure since only authenticated users can have access to the server. It should respect the 3 aspects :
2.3.5.1  Confidentiality:
 The user shall ensure who gets to see their Information.
    2.3.5.2 Integrity:
    
    2.3.5.3 Availability:
       The application shall be available at all times.
2.3.6 Maintainability:
                 The system should be easily maintainable to allow for additional upgrades that can be implemented in the future.
